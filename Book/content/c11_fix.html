      <h2>What Languages Fix</h2>
      <p>Kevin Kelleher suggested an interesting way to compare programming languages: to describe each in terms of the problem it fixes. The surprising thing is how many, and how well, languages can be described this way.</p>
      <p>Algol: Assembly language is too low-level.</p>
      <p>Pascal: Algol doesn't have enough data types.</p>
      <p>Modula: Pascal is too wimpy for systems programming.</p>
      <p>Simula: Algol isn't good enough at simulations.</p>
      <p>Smalltalk: Not everything in Simula is an object.</p>
      <p>Fortran: Assembly language is too low-level.</p>
      <p>Cobol: Fortran is scary.</p>
      <p>PL/1: Fortran doesn't have enough data types.</p>
      <p>Ada: Every existing language is missing something.</p>
      <p>Basic: Fortran is scary.</p>
      <p>APL: Fortran isn't good enough at manipulating arrays.</p>
      <p>J: APL requires its own character set.</p>
      <p>C: Assemby language is too low-level.</p>
      <p>C++: C is too low-level.</p>
      <p>Java: C++ is a kludge. And Microsoft is going to crush us.</p>
      <p>C#: Java is controlled by Sun.</p>
      <p>Lisp: Turing Machines are an awkward way to describe computation.</p>
      <p>Scheme: MacLisp is a kludge.</p>
      <p>T: Scheme has no libraries.</p>
      <p>Common Lisp: There are too many dialects of Lisp.</p>
      <p>Dylan: Scheme has no libraries, and Lisp syntax is scary.</p>
      <p>Perl: Shell scripts/awk/sed are not enough like programming languages.</p>
      <p>Python: Perl is a kludge.</p>
      <p>Ruby: Perl is a kludge, and Lisp syntax is scary.</p>
      <p>Prolog: Programming is not enough like logic.</p>
